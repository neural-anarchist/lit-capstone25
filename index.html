				A Lien follows Oscar and Sophia, a married couple, as they navigate an immigration interview with their daughter Nina, aiming to secure Oscar’s citizenship. The tension escalates when undocumented immigrants are detained nearby, and Oscar’s interview failure leads to his and Nina’s arrest. Sophia intervenes to save Nina by proving her residency, but she must bid a heart-wrenching farewell to Oscar as he is taken away.

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>
				<em>Lord of the Flies</em> begins with a group of boys stranded on an island after a plane crash, attempting to establish order under Ralph’s leadership with a conch as their symbol. Fear of a supposed beast fractures their unity, as Jack leads a faction into savagery, marked by hunting and violence, including two murders. The boys’ descent into chaos peaks when they set the island ablaze, though Ralph is ultimately rescued by a naval officer. The novel starkly illustrates the collapse of civilization without trust.

			</section>
			<section class="lotf-analysis-slide">
			<h2>Analysis</h2>
			<p>
				Golding probes the dark underbelly of human nature, suggesting that fear and distrust can unravel even the most innocent societies. The boys’ initial cooperation crumbles as fear amplifies their selfish instincts, leading to a violent breakdown of trust. Jack’s rise reflects how the absence of mutual reliance fosters chaos and destruction. Written in the shadow of World War II, the novel warns of the catastrophic consequences of abandoning trust.
			</p>
			</section>

			<section class="lotf-hook-slide">
			<h2>Hooking Back to the Thesis</h2>
			<p>
				By depicting the chaos unleashed when trust dissolves, <em>Lord of the Flies</em> reinforces the thesis that mutual trust is essential to overcoming hardship. The boys’ tragic fate vividly illustrates how its absence breeds savagery and despair.
